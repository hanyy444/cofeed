# Description

A fully responsive social media web application that helps users post images, like and comment on others’ posts, send real-time messages and follow each other.

    This project was developed solely for the purpose of learning, practicing and demonstrating my frontend development skills.
    
### Please! Note that if the app is taking too long to load data on first load. It's because the server is hosted on a free provider which shuts down the server when no requests are sent for a while. Please bare with it and refresh after some time. Thank you!
