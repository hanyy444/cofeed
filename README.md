# Description

# What I Learnt

1. Redux toolkit slices and its new action-creation logic encapsulation
2. Built real-time chat using google firestore
3. Implemented composable and reusable React hooks
   1. useClickOutside: detects a click outside an HTML element
   2. useAxios: encapsulates data fetching logic
   3. useTimeout: encapsulates setTimeout logic
   4. useEventListener: encapsulates event listeners logic
   5. useDebounce: debounces a callback function with a certain delay
   6. useSearchQuery: submits a debounced search request to the server
   7. and other application-related hooks…
4. Use formik & yup packages to handle the application forms
5. Vitest for unit testing
